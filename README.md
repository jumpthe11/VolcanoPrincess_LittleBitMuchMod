# VolcanoPrincess_LittleBitMuchMod
I do use ILSpy and dotPeek to reverseEngineer the game. ILSpy is lightweight and faster to search things but I think dotPeek has better decompiling because I saw some classes that does not appeared on ILSpy.

For coding I used Visual studio code.
Might you need get Harmonylib from nuget packs.

To see your changes build the project and move the dll file from bin/x64/netstandard2.1/LittleBitMuchMod.dll to your mod file.
